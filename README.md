# 🧠 OIBSIP Python Projects

This repository contains multiple Python-based projects created as part of my internship at **Oasis Infobyte** (OIBSIP). Each project demonstrates a key Python concept or application, from GUI tools to networking and automation.

## 📌 Projects Included

### 💬 1. Chat Application (`OIBSIP_PythonProgramming_5`)
A console-based chat system using **socket programming** and **multithreading**, allowing two users to communicate over a local network.

- 📡 Built with: `socket`, `threading`
- 💡 Features: 
  - Real-time messaging
  - Bi-directional communication
  - Threaded send/receive

---

### 🎙️ 2. Voice Assistant (`OIBSIP_PythonProgramming_1`)
A basic voice-controlled assistant that responds to user commands using speech recognition and text-to-speech.

- 🗣️ Built with: `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, `datetime`, `os`
- 🔍 Features:
  - Listens and responds
  - Performs tasks like time, web search, opening apps

---

### ⚖️ 3. BMI Calculator (`OIBSIP_PythonProgramming_2`)
A simple **BMI (Body Mass Index)** calculator that takes weight and height as input and classifies the result.

- 📐 Built with: Basic Python (`input`, `if-else`)
- 💡 Features:
  - Calculates BMI
  - Provides health classification (Underweight, Normal, Overweight)

---

### 🔐 4. Random Password Generator (`OIBSIP_PythonProgramming_3`)
A CLI tool that generates secure, random passwords based on user preferences (length, use of numbers, symbols, letters).

- 🔒 Built with: `random`, `string`
- 🔧 Features:
  - User-defined length
  - Toggle symbols/numbers/letters
  - Prevents weak passwords

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Standard libraries: `random`, `string`, `socket`, `threading`, etc.
- External packages: `pyttsx3`, `speech_recognition` (for voice assistant)

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Socket programming and networking fundamentals
- Multithreading and asynchronous communication
- Using Python for real-world applications like assistants and calculators
- Writing user-interactive and secure code

---

## 📅 Internship Details
This project was a part of my internship at **[Oasis Infobyte](https://oasisinfobyte.com/)** under the program **OIBSIP (Oasis Infobyte Internship and Student Program)**.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Add GUI using `Tkinter` or `PyQt` for all tools
- Host chat app over the internet
- Add natural language processing to the voice assistant
- Store BMI history and password logs (securely)
